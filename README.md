## Project Overview

The Maths Game is a web-based game designed to enhance methametical skills. It challenges players with multiplicatiob questions, rewarding them for correct answers and displaying their overall score when the game ends. the game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play

1. Start the Game:
    - Click the "Start game" button to begin. if you wer alredy playing, the game will be reset.
    
2. Game Mechanics:

    - You will be presented with a multiplication question and four answer options.
    - select the correct answer by clicking its' box, to score a point.
    - If you choose the correct answer, a "Correct" message box will briefly apper. Otehrwise, a "Try Again" message box will be displayed.
    - Continue answering questions before the timer runs out.
    
3. Scoring:

    - your score is displayed in real-time.
    
4. Game Over:
    - When the timer reaches zero, a "Game Over" message will be shown.
    - The message will display your final score.


## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used to structure the content and layout of the web page.
- CSS3: Used for styling.
- JavaScript: Implemented game logic and interactivity.

## Challenges

Initially, this project used simple methods for layout and display.
These were later improved by using JavaScript to handle game logic and interactions.

## Future Improvement

In the future, this project could be enhanced with additional features such as:
- Dificulty levels (e.g. easy, medium, hard).
- More mathematical questions (e.g. addition, subtraction, division and modulus).
- Leaderboards to track high scores.
- Improved user interface and animations
